        'Uniform provisions in the case of Civil servants other than allottees is necessary to avoid discrimination. Hence the Bill.  Necessary approval of the Central Government in terms of the proviso to sub-section (7) of  section 115 of the States Re-organisation Act, 1956 has been obtained.   (Published in the Karnataka Gazette Part IV-2A (Extraordinary) No. 263, dated 15-3-1973  at page 12-13.)   Amending Act 40 of 76 -  [By this Act, the Karnataka Service Examinations, Act, 1976 was  enacted and therein certain consequential amendment were made to this Act and a new section  9A was inserted.]   Amending Act 25 of 1982 - The Karnataka State Civil Services (Regulation of Promotion,  Pay and Pension) Act, 1973 (Act 11 of 1973) was passed in the year 1974 providing for regulation of promotion, pay and pension and other conditions of service of civil servants including those who were allotted or are deemed to have been allotted to serve in connection with the affairs of the new State under section 115 of the States Re-organisation Act, 1956.  2. The promotions made from 1-11-1956 were to be reviewed under section 4 (1) of the Act  on the basis of the Final I.S.S Lists published in accordance with the decisions of the Government  of India. While so reviewing the promotions it was noticed that some officers who were promoted  earlier on the basis of their positions in the provisional I.S.S Lists were eligible for promotion on  dates later than the dates of their actual promotion. This would mean that the earlier promotion  was fortuitous and the pay was therefore required to be revised. There was no provision in the  Act for regulation of pay in such cases. It was considered necessary to make a provision in the  Act providing for refixation of pay in respect of such officers on the dates of eligibility.  3. Besides, there is an anomaly in the Karnataka Service Examinations Act, 1976. Section  8(2) of the said Act amends section 3 of the Karnataka State Civil Services (Regulation of  Promotion, Pay and Pension) Act, 1973. The 1976 Act came into force with effect from 1-11- 1956 while section 3 of the 1973 Act  came  into  force  with effect from 11-4-1974. The  amending provision cannot come into force from a date anterior to the date on which the original  provision came into force. To remove this  anomaly Section 8 of the Karnataka Service  Examinations Act, 1976 is sought to be amended suitably.   4. Hence this Bill.   (Published in the Karnataka Gazette Part IV-2A (Extraordinary) No. 223, dated 31-3-1981  page 4.)   KARNATAKA ACT No. 11 OF 1974  (First Published in the Karnataka Gazette Extraordinary on the Eleventh day of April,  1974)  THE KARNATAKA STATE CIVIL SERVICES (REGULATION OF PROMOTION,  PAY AND PENSION) ACT, 1973  (Received the assent of the Governor on the Eleventh day of April, 1974)  (As amended by Karnataka Acts 40 of 1976 and 25 of 1982)   An Act to provide for the prospective promotions of civil servants and to regulate the pay, seniority, pension and other conditions of service of civil servants in the State of Karnataka including those that are allotted or deemed to be allotted to serve in connection with the affairs of the State of Karnataka under or in pursuance of section  115 of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956;  WHEREAS on the basis of the ranking of civil servants in the several inter-state seniority lists prepared in pursuance of sub-section (5) of section 115 of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956 (Central Act 37 of 1956), courts have directed the making of retrospective promotions to statutory and other offices;  AND whereas as held by the Supreme Court in Ajit Singh Vs.

        'Uniform provisions in the case of Civil servants other than allottees is necessary to avoid discrimination. Hence the Bill.  Necessary approval of the Central Government in terms of the proviso to sub-section (7) of  section 115 of the States Re-organisation Act, 1956 has been obtained.   (Published in the Karnataka Gazette Part IV-2A (Extraordinary) No. 263, dated 15-3-1973  at page 12-13.)   Amending Act 40 of 76 -  [By this Act, the Karnataka Service Examinations, Act, 1976 was  enacted and therein certain consequential amendment were made to this Act and a new section  9A was inserted.]   Amending Act 25 of 1982 - The Karnataka State Civil Services (Regulation of Promotion,  Pay and Pension) Act, 1973 (Act 11 of 1973) was passed in the year 1974 providing for regulation of promotion, pay and pension and other conditions of service of civil servants including those who were allotted or are deemed to have been allotted to serve in connection with the affairs of the new State under section 115 of the States Re-organisation Act, 1956.  2. The promotions made from 1-11-1956 were to be reviewed under section 4 (1) of the Act  on the basis of the Final I.S.S Lists published in accordance with the decisions of the Government  of India. While so reviewing the promotions it was noticed that some officers who were promoted  earlier on the basis of their positions in the provisional I.S.S Lists were eligible for promotion on  dates later than the dates of their actual promotion. This would mean that the earlier promotion  was fortuitous and the pay was therefore required to be revised. There was no provision in the  Act for regulation of pay in such cases. It was considered necessary to make a provision in the  Act providing for refixation of pay in respect of such officers on the dates of eligibility.  3. Besides, there is an anomaly in the Karnataka Service Examinations Act, 1976. Section  8(2) of the said Act amends section 3 of the Karnataka State Civil Services (Regulation of  Promotion, Pay and Pension) Act, 1973. The 1976 Act came into force with effect from 1-11- 1956 while section 3 of the 1973 Act  came  into  force  with effect from 11-4-1974. The  amending provision cannot come into force from a date anterior to the date on which the original  provision came into force. To remove this  anomaly Section 8 of the Karnataka Service  Examinations Act, 1976 is sought to be amended suitably.   4. Hence this Bill.   (Published in the Karnataka Gazette Part IV-2A (Extraordinary) No. 223, dated 31-3-1981  page 4.)   KARNATAKA ACT No. 11 OF 1974  (First Published in the Karnataka Gazette Extraordinary on the Eleventh day of April,  1974)  THE KARNATAKA STATE CIVIL SERVICES (REGULATION OF PROMOTION,  PAY AND PENSION) ACT, 1973  (Received the assent of the Governor on the Eleventh day of April, 1974)  (As amended by Karnataka Acts 40 of 1976 and 25 of 1982)   An Act to provide for the prospective promotions of civil servants and to regulate the pay, seniority, pension and other conditions of service of civil servants in the State of Karnataka including those that are allotted or deemed to be allotted to serve in connection with the affairs of the State of Karnataka under or in pursuance of section  115 of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956;  WHEREAS on the basis of the ranking of civil servants in the several inter-state seniority lists prepared in pursuance of sub-section (5) of section 115 of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956 (Central Act 37 of 1956), courts have directed the making of retrospective promotions to statutory and other offices;  AND whereas as held by the Supreme Court in Ajit Singh Vs.
